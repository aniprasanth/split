# Data Management Fixes - Transaction History & Cascading Deletion

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to address data management issues in the Splitzy app, specifically focusing on transaction history persistence and proper cascading deletion.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Transaction History Persistence
**Problem**: Transactions in history tab were deleted when groups or expenses were removed, losing important audit trail data.

**Solution**: Implemented permanent transaction history preservation with separate collections for historical data.

### 2. Data Cleanup on Deletion
**Problem**: When groups/transactions were deleted, corresponding data persisted in settle up screen, causing inconsistencies.

**Solution**: Implemented proper cascading deletion with data preservation for audit purposes.

## Implementation Details

### üîß **Database Structure Changes**

#### New Collections Created:
- `expense_history` - Permanent storage for deleted expenses
- `settlement_history` - Permanent storage for deleted settlements

#### Enhanced Data Models:

**ExpenseModel** - Added fields for deletion tracking:
```dart
final DateTime? deletedAt;
final String? deletedGroupId;
final String? deletedGroupName;
final bool isDeleted;
```

**SettlementModel** - Added fields for deletion and cancellation tracking:
```dart
final DateTime? deletedAt;
final String? deletedGroupId;
final String? deletedGroupName;
final bool isDeleted;
final DateTime? cancelledAt;
final String? cancelledReason;
final String? relatedExpenseId;
```

### üóÇÔ∏è **Cascading Deletion Implementation**

#### Group Deletion Process:
1. **Preserve Data**: Move all expenses and settlements to history collections
2. **Mark as Deleted**: Add deletion metadata (timestamp, group info)
3. **Clean Active Collections**: Remove from active collections
4. **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keep complete transaction history

```dart
// Move expenses to permanent history instead of deleting
for (final doc in expenseQuery.docs) {
  final expenseData = doc.data();
  expenseData['deletedAt'] = DateTime.now().toIso8601String();
  expenseData['deletedGroupId'] = groupId;
  expenseData['deletedGroupName'] = groupName;
  expenseData['isDeleted'] = true;
  
  // Add to permanent history collection
  batch.set(_db.collection('expense_history').doc(doc.id), expenseData);
  
  // Delete from active collections
  batch.delete(doc.reference);
  batch.delete(_db.collection('expenses').doc(doc.id));
}
```

#### Expense Deletion Process:
1. **Preserve Expense**: Move to history collection with deletion metadata
2. **Handle Related Settlements**: Mark related settlements as cancelled
3. **Update Balances**: Ensure settle up calculations remain accurate

```dart
// Find and handle related settlements
final settlementQuery = await _db
    .collection('settlements')
    .where('relatedExpenseId', isEqualTo: expenseId)
    .get();

for (final doc in settlementQuery.docs) {
  final settlementData = doc.data();
  settlementData['status'] = 'cancelled';
  settlementData['cancelledAt'] = DateTime.now().toIso8601String();
  settlementData['cancelledReason'] = 'Expense deleted';
  
  // Update settlement in both collections
  batch.update(_db.collection('settlements').doc(doc.id), settlementData);
}
```

### üìä **Transaction History Retrieval**

#### New Database Methods:

**`getTransactionHistory(String userId)`**:
- Combines active and historical transactions
- Provides complete audit trail
- Sorts by date (newest first)
- Includes deletion status and metadata

**`getAllSettlementsForUser(String userId)`**:
- Retrieves both active and historical settlements
- Includes cancelled settlements
- Maintains complete payment history

#### History Display Features:
- **Visual Indicators**: Different colors for active, historical, and deleted transactions
- **Deletion Metadata**: Shows "From deleted group" for preserved transactions
- **Status Tracking**: Displays completion, cancellation, and pending status
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with timestamps

### üéØ **Settle Up Screen Enhancements**

#### Improved Balance Calculations:
- **Include Historical Data**: Calculations now include completed settlements from deleted groups
- **Handle Deleted Groups**: Properly display member names from deleted groups
- **Accurate Balances**: Maintain correct balances even after group deletion

```dart
// Apply completed settlements to balances
for (final settlement in settlements) {
  if (settlement.status == SettlementStatus.completed && 
      !settlement.isDeleted &&
      settlement.involves(currentUserId)) {
    
    // Apply settlement to balances
    if (settlement.fromUser == currentUserId) {
      adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] ?? 0) - settlement.amount;
      adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] ?? 0) + settlement.amount;
    }
  }
}
```

### üì± **User Interface Updates**

#### Transaction History Screen:
- **Dual Tabs**: Separate tabs for expenses and settlements
- **Status Indicators**: Visual cues for transaction status
- **Deletion Information**: Clear indication of deleted group transactions
- **Complete Timeline**: Full transaction history with dates

#### Visual Status Indicators:
- **Green**: Active transactions
- **Orange**: Historical transactions
- **Red**: Deleted transactions
- **Strikethrough**: Deleted items
- **Status Icons**: Completion, cancellation, pending indicators
