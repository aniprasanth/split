# Settle Up Screen Enhancements - Dynamic Display & Label Clarity

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements implemented for the Settle Up screen to improve user experience through dynamic settlement display and clearer labeling.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Dynamic Settlement Display
**Problem**: All transactions were shown regardless of settlement status, creating confusion about what actually needs to be settled.

**Solution**: Implemented filtering to show only unsettled transactions, with immediate removal when marked as settled.

### 2. Label Clarity Improvements
**Problem**: Labels like "You owe" and "Owes you" were not intuitive and could be confusing.

**Solution**: Updated to clearer "To Give" and "To Get" terminology for better user understanding.

## Implementation Details

### üéØ **Dynamic Settlement Display**

#### **Current Behavior**:
- **Before**: All transactions displayed regardless of settlement status
- **After**: Only unsettled transactions are shown
- **Immediate Update**: Transactions disappear immediately when marked as settled

#### **Technical Implementation**:
The settlement calculation now properly filters out completed settlements:

```dart
// Apply completed settlements to balances
final Map<String, double> adjustedBalances = Map.from(balances);

for (final settlement in settlements) {
  if (settlement.status == SettlementStatus.completed &&
      !settlement.isDeleted &&
      settlement.involves(currentUserId)) {
    
    // Apply settlement to balances - this effectively removes settled amounts
    if (settlement.fromUser == currentUserId) {
      adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] ?? 0) - settlement.amount;
      adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] ?? 0) + settlement.amount;
    } else if (settlement.toUser == currentUserId) {
      adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.fromUser] ?? 0) - settlement.amount;
      adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] = 
          (adjustedBalances[settlement.toUser] ?? 0) + settlement.amount;
    }
  }
}

// Only show unsettled amounts (balances > 0.01 threshold for rounding)
adjustedBalances.forEach((memberId, balance) {
  if (memberId != currentUserId && balance.abs() > 0.01) {
    if (balance > 0) {
      owesYou[memberId] = balance; // To Get
    } else {
      youOwe[memberId] = -balance; // To Give
    }
  }
});
```

#### **Real-time Updates**:
- **Stream-based Architecture**: UI automatically refreshes when settlements are added
- **Immediate Feedback**: Transactions disappear as soon as "Mark as Settled" is clicked
- **No Manual Refresh**: Users don't need to manually refresh the screen

### üè∑Ô∏è **Label Clarity Improvements**

#### **Tab Labels Updated**:
```dart
// Before
Tab(text: 'You Owe'),
Tab(text: 'Owes You'),

// After
Tab(text: 'To Give'),
Tab(text: 'To Get'),
```

#### **Card Labels Updated**:
```dart
// Before
isOwesYou ? 'owes you' : 'you owe'

// After
isOwesYou ? 'to get' : 'to give'
```

#### **Total Amount Labels Updated**:
```dart
// Before
isOwesYou ? 'Total owed to you' : 'Total you owe'

// After
isOwesYou ? 'Total to get' : 'Total to give'
```

#### **Reminder Messages Enhanced**:
```dart
// Before
'Hi $name! Just a friendly reminder that you owe me ‚Çπ${amount}. Thanks!'
'Hi $name! I owe you ‚Çπ${amount}. Let me know when you\'d like me to settle up!'

// After
'Hi $name! Just a friendly reminder that you owe me ‚Çπ${amount} to settle up. Thanks!'
'Hi $name! I owe you ‚Çπ${amount} to settle up. Let me know when you\'d like me to pay!'
```
